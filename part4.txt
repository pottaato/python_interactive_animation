- 1 	3 points 	Animate your creatures (and your environmental features if it makes sense to do so). If creatures / environmental features move off of the screen, recreate them on the other side or have them bounce off the side.
Clouds (creatures) do flips when hit the canvas's right or left edges.

- 2 	3 points 	Experiment with different kinds of motion. Instead of your creatures moving linearly at a constant speed, you can experiment with the math.sin and math.cos functions (or any others techniques) to make your creature oscillate, accelerate, decelerate, etc.
"hotairballoon"s move with random upward angle and random speeds, clouds move left-right and random initial speeds.

- 3 	3 points 	Spawn a new creature or landscape object when the user either clicks or drags or right-clicks the screen (you can also use a keyboard event).
Spawn a new "hotairballoon" on click

- 4 	3 points 	Animate each of your creatures (all of your original 5) so that their movement is different (different speeds AND different movement patterns).
"hotairballoon"s and clouds move with different speed and different movement

- 6 	3 points 	Periodically (repeatedly) add or remove creatures and/or landscape objects to/from your scene.
Repeatedly add cars from the left side.

- 7 	3 points 	When you click a creature, remove it from the screen (you can also assign a particular keyboard key to delete a creature (but it needs to be able to be hit more than once without causing an error))
Remove a "hotairballoon, a cloud, or a car on double-click

- 11 	3 points 	Make your creature or landscape feature periodically (repeatedly) change colors.
"hotairballoon"s repeatedly change color.
